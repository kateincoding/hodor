One of the bests project that I made in my story with Holberton! I really enjoyed!
It is an optional project! But I recommend to do it! You can do it with your preference language. For this project, I choose Python with the module Requests

# Resources

* HTTP headers
* Scraping
* OCR for Captcha
* TOR
* Proxy lists
